            <Paragraph>
              It’s hard to believe that it was almost six months ago that we
              first experienced the impact of this pandemic. A great loss of
              life, an uncertain economy, the difficulty to plan ahead. The
              challenges of this virus are vast. Like many sports around the
              globe, the climbing community has been greatly tested by the
              pandemic. Climbing requires securing holds with sweaty hands,
              something that can easily transmit the spread of a virus. As a
              result, gyms closed. World cups were canceled. The Tokyo Olympics
              were postponed to 2021. Although these measures were necessary for
              the safety of athletes and fans of the sport, it has greatly
              impacted the people who live off climbing.

              Beatrix Evans is a professional route setter at Allez Up in
              Montreal and a core community ambassador of the Arcteryx brand. An
              established climber, Bea lives and breathes the sport. If she is
              not spending hours in the gym training or coaching, she is
              exploring the outdoors in pursuit of challenges and projects. Once
              a competitor at the highest level with participation in IFSC
              Bouldering World Cups for Team Canada, Bea will pursue academic
              studies at the Concordia University John Molson School of Business
              this Fall. Just like her peers in the community, she greatly
              suffered the results of the pandemic shut down. Impossible to
              work, train, or socialize. On top of the difficulty to live off
              unemployment, the sudden halt of any physical activity is a
              nightmare for any athlete. From the adrenaline of finishing a
              route to the simple routine of being active, climbers like Bea
              need to move to feel alive. Confined at home for the majority of
              the spring, she learned to adapt to her new life. Exploring the
              outdoors became a source of much-needed motivation and creativity.
              From parks to the urban landscapes, Bea took any opportunity to
              get out of the house and feel alive again.

              Mathieu Tranchida is a professional outdoor photographer
              specialized in capturing movement in sports. A recent JMSB
              graduate in International Business, he is also an accomplished
              skier and an aspiring climber. Before the virus, he spent three
              months in the Swiss Alps to shoot the movie “From Switzerland with
              Love” produced by freeride skier Laurent de Martin. Just like Bea
              and other members of the climbing community, Mathieu had to learn
              to live months without any new adventures or photoshoots. As time
              passed, his hunger for creativity and challenges pushed him
              outside the house. Whether it was a morning walk or a long bike
              ride, he always took out his camera to capture precious moments.

            <Paragraph>
              Mathieu Tranchida and Beatrix Evans represent the community of
              artists and climbers who faced this crisis head-on. Although
              initially frightened by the halt of their activities, aspirations,
              and livelihood, they overcame these challenges by doing what they
              know best: staying on the move and being creative. And as the
              climbing community found a way to explore urban climbing and
              escape quarantine, Mathieu and Bea channeled their creativity to
              also take part in this exploration.

            <Section>Part Two: The Olympic Park</Section>
            <Paragraph>
              As it often does, it all started with a boulder: The OnSite rocks
              at the Montreal Olympic Stadium. When lockdown restrictions eased
              up, Bea started climbing this unique site with her friends. With
              three granite blocks weighing over 130,000 pounds, it was the
              perfect playground for Bea to get back in shape and leave the
              house. Through social media, Mathieu contacted her to go back and
              shoot the boulders together. Coming from the ski community,
              Mathieu knows the urban potential of the Olympic park, where many
              legendary street segments have taken place. Following his first
              shot, however, Mathieu foresaw his surroundings with a climbing
              vision and a craving to hunt new unexplored urban climbing sites.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              After careful planning, they decided to reach the OnSite boulder
              for sunrise. Burdened with heavy equipment, the duo slowly biked
              their way towards the site in the darkness of the night. As the
              rays of the sun first made their appearance a little past five in
              the morning, Mathieu anxiously prepared his gear to catch the
              perfect lighting while Bea visualized her climb. After failing to
              get in the right position at the start, the pair were able to
              capture the shot at just the right moment. And as Bea describes
              it, getting the timing right is always an adventure:
            </Paragraph>
            <Quote>
              “When we started climbing/shooting I was still sleepy and having a
              hard time doing the last two moves of the boulder, I kept falling
              and Mathieu could not take his ideal photo! I felt embarrassed and
              especially worried that I wouldn’t be able to send the boulder and
              the shoot would be ruined. I started to get annoyed, I really
              wanted to send. Not only to get the shot but once I try a boulder,
              I usually want to get it done. I gave it one last try and finally
              managed to top out the boulder! It’s funny because Mathieu thought
              that the ideal timing for the sun/lighting had already passed but
              finally everything lined up just at the right moment and we got an
              amazing photo!”
            </Quote>
            <Paragraph>
              While Bea was relieved she had managed to send the boulder just in
              time, Mathieu was also really pleased with the result:
            </Paragraph>
            <Quote>
              “This shoot ended up giving me one of my favorite pictures of this
              year. I love this shot because the background is unique, the
              colors look beautiful and Bea’s position is perfect.”
            </Quote>
            <Paragraph>
              What ensued was a series of photoshoots around the park, each time
              searching for a different way to blend the urban environment with
              the climbs.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              Capturing the traverse across a steep wall of an alleyway
              illuminated the duo’s creativity. With a series of thin pinches
              running vertically along the wall, Bea had to use all her strength
              to maintain a hold on the face. The challenge of the climb was
              very real, and it took her several falls on the pad to find a
              comfortable position. Eventually, she found a nice sequence up the
              tufas and felt confident with her movement. Mathieu then suggested
              removing the pads to “give the shot a more minimal and focused
              look”. As Bea would later describe, she did not see the importance
              of clearing the pads until she saw the final shot:
            </Paragraph>
            <Quote>
              “When Mathieu suggested that we remove the pads, I didn’t think it
              was that important. Throughout the series, he would often ask my
              artistic opinion of a composition or idea and I would always
              respond “I don’t know, you're the artist.” It was kind of a joke
              but this shot shows exactly why. He was always totally right - the
              photos turned out absolutely stunning.”
            </Quote>
            <Paragraph>
              Blending climbing virtuoso and artistic talent, this picture
              captured Bea’s elegance as a climber while also grasping the
              minimal look of their environment.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              On a late August evening, the pair were able to capture a unique
              moment. Originally scheduled for earlier in the summer, this
              particular shoot at the Olympic stadium was postponed due to
              construction in the area. When access to the site became possible,
              Mathieu and Bea jumped on the opportunity. Usually buzzing with
              tourists, the area was completely empty. As the sun began to set
              on the imposing structure of the stadium, the silence and rarity
              of the moment struck Bea by surprise:
            </Paragraph>
            <Quote>
              “To me, the photo emphasizes the gravity of the COVID19
              quarantine. We were at the Olympic Stadium on a Friday afternoon
              and there was no one in sight! (Aside from the security guard).
              Usually, the stadium is occupied with tourists admiring the
              bizarre building and impressiveness of its scale. But since
              everyone was locked away at home the city was always empty and
              ours to explore.”
            </Quote>
            <Paragraph>
              And explore it they did. As an urban skiing photographer, Mathieu
              knew the risks of getting kicked out of a site by security. When
              he saw Bea was in the right position, he did not have to wait long
              until a park security car pulled up. Carefully positioned with his
              gear at a distance, Mathieu was able to seize the moment.
              Highlighting the challenges of urban climbing as well as the
              impact of COVID on the community, this photo grasps the essence of
              this summer of climbing in Montreal.

            <Section>Part Three: Mixing aesthetics and climbing</Section>
            <Paragraph>
              After exploring the Olympic Stadium, Mathieu and Bea craved for
              more. More creativity and more urban spots to climb. From
              overlooking bridges to rising facades, the duo embraced the sites
              of the city. Just like a climber opening the path for a new route,
              Bea and Mathieu explored what paths and areas could be
              aesthetically creative and interesting to climb.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              Their first venture took place in Old Port, seconds away from
              Mathieu’s apartment. Challenging on a climbing and artistic scale,
              this stone bridge had been a source of inspiration long before the
              pandemic. Mathieu decided to take Bea and begin a series of shoots
              in the area.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              As Mathieu detailed, the bridge presented a few obstacles:
            </Paragraph>
            <Quote>
              “The lighting was very difficult; the angle of the bridge makes
              for harsh shadows and somber colors. We had to time our shoot
              around the parking schedule and regulate the bike lane. There is a
              lot of traffic in and around the bridge during the day. This made
              it tricky to get the emptiness of the shot I was searching for.
              Not to mention the fact that it’s dangerous to climb above
              cyclists. I like this photo because it has a very urban look. We
              really were climbing in the middle of a big city and this photo
              has it all - the long stretch of road, expensive cars, and
              buildings in the background. Everything a city has to offer.”
            </Quote>
            <Paragraph>
              The duo arrived at half-past six on a Sunday morning to catch the
              right lighting. While befuddled pedestrians strolled past, Bea
              prepared for the ascent. Although the bridge is an urban
              structure, the arrangement of rocks in large blocks felt like an
              outdoor climbing route. With real climbing moves and a sheer drop,
              Bea decided to use a self-belay line. As she made her way up the
              bridge wall, Mathieu patiently waited for the streets to clear. As
              Bea recalled:
            </Paragraph>
            <Quote>
              “While we were climbing a few groups of people passed under the
              bridge on their way home from what seemed to be crazy nights out.
              It was hilarious to witness their reactions - a perfect mix of
              confusion and amazement.”
            </Quote>
            <Paragraph>
              Continuing on their quest for urban exploration, the pair took on
              another bridge. Drawn by the structure's aesthetics and colors,
              Mathieu did not visualize a climbing line at first. Bea suggested
              she could traverse underneath and hang above the water. Although
              the traverse was relatively easy to climb, perfecting the shot was
              a real challenge for Mathieu:
            </Paragraph>
            <Quote>
              “I found it very challenging to get the reflection in the water to
              pop - which was my main goal for this photo. Shooting on a
              wide-angle lens did not make it any easier. I was struggling to
              get the composition that I wanted - finally, I found it, knee-deep
              in the water trying not to drop my camera. In the end, I got a
              great photo! I feel that this shot really represents the “climb
              with what you have” attitude many climbers adopted during the
              quarantine.”
            </Quote>
            <Paragraph>
              Meanwhile, Bea was pleased with the photo but felt she did not
              deserve publishing the piece due to its lack of difficulty.
              However, she quickly realized that this exploration was not just
              about finding a climbing challenge:
            </Paragraph>
            <Quote>
              “Maybe urban bouldering/exploration isn’t necessarily all about
              the athletic aspect of pushing yourself to reach new grades or
              levels. It's about exploring the city through a new lens. Even
              climbing in and of itself isn’t always all about pushing yourself,
              sometimes it can simply be about enjoying movement and exotic
              places and/or beautiful spots. I didn’t want the series to be
              purely aesthetic, but it is interesting to have a mix. Seeing both
              my side - searching for urban boulders/projects - and Mathieu’s
              side - searching for stunning locations while featuring climbing.”
            </Quote>
            <Paragraph>
              Continuing on this path, a new bridge photo shoot at sunset
              created a special atmosphere. With orange-gold and hues of pink
              stretching across the clouds, Mathieu was thrilled with the
              composition of the shot. Bea’s floating body position blended with
              the setting sun seemed to suspend time.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              Nevertheless, capturing the moment took patience and courage. Bea
              was free soloing a dozen meters above the ground, holding the
              perfect position until Mathieu seized the shot. Highly trained and
              experienced, there was no reason for Bea to fall. But climbing is
              never free of risk, and it took a lot of focus and strength for
              everything to go smoothly. According to Bea, this was her biggest
              test yet:
            </Paragraph>
            <Quote>
              “This photo was the highest stress shoot for me. It was the most
              “free-solo style” of all the spots we visited. The bridge was
              probably around ten meters high and fifteen meters across. To get
              the shot, I had to climb up the side of the bridge, traverse
              across to the middle (where we would take the photo) and
              eventually make my way back down. It was like climbing a route up
              and down. Technically it was not difficult to climb, there was a
              nice ledge all the way that served both as a great handhold and
              toe/heel hooks. However, I had set and forerun all day at Allez Up
              so my body was tired. I really needed to stay calm - if you panic
              or worry your muscles will tense up and the pump will become more
              intense. This is dangerous when falling is not an option. I
              focused on my breathing, maintaining a relaxed facial
              expression/posture, and making very solid toe/heel hook
              placements. Once Mathieu told me he got the shot I desperately
              pulled up to sit on top of the beams and rest before climbing back
              down. I made it back accident-free and was relieved when Mathieu
              told me that he got the shot - I wouldn’t need to repeat the
              climb. I don’t know if Mathieu realized how pumped and tired I was
              - I hope not because that would have been very stressful to
              watch/photograph.”

            <Paragraph>
              The last shoot of the Old Port series took place on the facade of
              a building on the corner of Recollets and Saint-Helene. Thrilled
              to shoot a different architectural design and diversify their
              creative collection, Mathieu was pleasantly surprised with the
              result. Anxious about drawing attention, the duo only brought
              minimal gear to secure the moment in a flash. It only took one try
              for Bea to reach her position, and the duo quickly biked away
              unnoticed.

              Closing their urban adventures in Old Montreal, this photo once
              again connects the realities of climbing during this pandemic.
              Empty streets, an urban playground, and the creative desire to
              explore. That is what Bea, Mathieu, and the climbing community
              will continue to embrace.

            <Section>Part Four: Kaleb's Boulder</Section>
            <Paragraph>
              After exploring the city together, Mathieu and Bea wanted to share
              their experiences and learn from others in the climbing community.
              Kaleb Thomas, Bea’s mentor, and friend is the national head route
              setter and a pioneer in urban climbing. He invited the duo to
              climb a builder he had set up in a park near his home. This was an
              exciting opportunity to discover a new form of urban climbing and
              watch Kaleb work. As Bea recalls, it was the most challenging
              climb of their summer:
            </Paragraph>
            <Quote>
              “This boulder was set by my friend and mentor Kaleb Thomas during
              the quarantine. He glued plastic climbing holds onto a metal
              structure in a park near his place. It is interesting how he had
              the vision to truly mix urban exploration, climbing, and route
              setting. He set a HARD climb. I could barely do a single move on
              the boulder. This was definitely the hardest climbing of the
              entire series. I was exhausted but impressed by Kaleb’s grit and
              motivation. He was climbing strong!”

              Just like Kaleb, many climbers in the community also took their
              talents outside the gym and made the most of these trying
              circumstances. It was a special experience for Bea and Mathieu to
              discover the creativity and challenges of urban climbing and be
              able to share their adventures with the rest of the community.
